# Fabricate a polyhedron

There is something magical about holding a polyhedron, like you are holding something from another dimension, like Plato's realm of forms materialized. I've noticed this feeling is reinforced by a couple factors:

- the durability of the object
- the precision of the geometry

The best outcome for this assignment is that by hand-crafting a polyhedron you become intimately aquainted with one take on non-rectilinear 3D space. Be as liberal with this interpretation as you like!

Browse the inspiration section for a polyhedra you think you might like. I would suggest starting with one of either the Platonic, Archimedean, or Johnson solids. Avoid the cube, though transformed/truncated cubes like the [rhombicuboctahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicuboctahedron) can work. Consider the material/fabrication process at the same time you're picking a polyhedron.

### Materials

- Posterboard is easy to work with, it won't be unheard of to attempt a stellated polyhedron.
- wood requires consideration of thickness, maybe shaping of the dihedral angles, a simple dodecahedron would be nice

If you're thinking of using paper, consider posterboard; the more solid, the better. Having a wood polyhedron to keep around for the rest of your life *will pay you back!* The piece will look beautiful. Consider different kinds of plastic, metal, (glass?). Imagine a functional-take on the assignment by wrapping a paper polyhedron lampshade around a lightbulb.

**Make use of the studio fabrication tools**, I can imagine the laser cutter especially being perfect for this assignment.

If you are using thick material for faces and want a flush edge, the bevel angle you want is *half of the dihedral angle*. 

### Inspiration

Take a look at some links below, or search for "fabricate a polyhedron _ (material)  _ ". Remember you can construct a solid-face structure or a skeleton-like structure by only making the edges, or get entirely creative with your interpretation.

Here is a site with a bunch of nets (wikipedia is also good for this), though you might want to re-create them to be in the proper vector format (in most vector drawing programs it's super easy to create regular polygons and snap them together).
