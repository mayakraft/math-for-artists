k means relates to Voroni in shaders

## Boolean logic

[deMorgan's law]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan's_laws)) in an if-statement. `( a` `**&& b**` `) == !( a` `**|| b**` `)`

## higher dimensions

[great introduction, featuring Henry Segerman's work](https://researchblog.duke.edu/2017/04/26/visualizing-the-fourth-dimension/)

two ways of imagining higher dimensions: slices and shadows

animations of a hypercube rotating in 4d space

imagine constructing one of the [regular 4-polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-polytope) in code. use vec4 instead of vec3. upon rendering, the extra 4th dimension just gets flattened.

Flatland: a flatlander asks a 3D creature to prove they are 3D. they still only see slices. the 3D creater can look inside of boxes, they can

### Slower speed of light

analysis of projection matrices. how they project 3D space into 2D. (don't worry about z-ordering). how you can bend and break them like in Slower speed of light.

## undecidable problems

decision problems, Hilbert, Russel, Turing, GÃ¶del, and the reducibility of a formal system. MU puzzle. halting problem.

## conics

David Huffman and conics in curved-crease origami. [paper 1](http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Huffman_Origami5/paper.pdf) more stuff in #1. [paper 2](http://erikdemaine.org/papers/HuffmanTess_JMD2013/paper.pdf)

ellipses: Draw them with a string and 2 tacks. Talk about the reflection deal: satellite dishes, whisper dishes, back of lamps.

## geodesics

a geodesic sphere can be made from any of the triangular-faced polyhedra. subdivide the triangles like the first step of a Seirpinski, and repeat. balloon it up as though every dot on the surface lies along the sphere.

check out [this image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Geodesic_icosahedral_polyhedron_example.png) as a reference

(a dome is made by taking a slice of that)

notice how pretty much every vertex is degree-6. can you spot the degree-5s? how many are there? *they relate to the original icosahedron (polyhedron) vertices.*
