### Aspect ratio tool

Create a tool to solve all your image-scaling needs. This tool will scale one rectangle to fit another. Your code is going to need to be able to ask the question: *is the width or the height the limiting factor?* Two takes on the assignment: beginner and advanced:

- linear transform only: ignore moving the origin. only deal with **width** and **height** variables
- move the origin. maintain that both rectangle's origins are at the center.

The input you need from the user are:

- frame rectangle width and height
- picture rectangle width and height

the outputs generated are:

- picture rectangle width and height, and the **scalar** multiplier that took it there.
- if you are doing advanced, assume the input rectangle's origin is 0, 0, give us the **new origin** for the picture rectangle.

**Aspect-fit** can be the default behavior, but it's likely that you'll want to offer **aspect-fill** as well.

### Written assignment

The [Wikipedia page for House of Wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom#Notable_people) has a decent list of notible mathematicians and philosophers from the Abassid period, the period that was key to connecting Ancient Greek math and philosphy to the European Renaissance. Select a person from this list and write about them. Write about an idea of theirs and the impact of it. Often these inventions are commonplace to us (like the invention of negative numbers), if necessary describe the landscape at the time to help explain why their inventions were so novel.
