# Math for Artists

Spring 2020

ITP, 370 Jay St, room 409

Thursdays, 6:30 - 9 PM

Instructor: Robby Kraft, rk132@nyu.edu

Office Hours: Monday 11am - 1pm

## Course Details

In this class students will learn math tools to boost their digital practice, fix common problems, and understand the math behind our human perception of the physical world. This course spans different branches of math including geometry, linear algebra, logarithmic thinking, and statistics as they relate to a programmer making digital art with our contemporary media ecosystem. The aim of this course isn't to solve equations, rather strengthen our intuition accompanied with historical and ethnomathematics perspectives and foster a healthy relationship to a few branches of math. The prerequisites to this class are basic arithmetic skills and an introduction to programming. We will create applications using free and open-source software, including p5.js, and Pure Data.

## Work

Students will be expected to demonstrate understanding of the material by creating projects and assignments each week, varying from computer programs to physical artworks. Students are expected to deepen their relationship to math. This class concludes with a final project to create a work of math art. The class covers many of the dimensions of math, students should pay attention to the areas that excite them most for contenders for final projects.

## Conduct

Students are expected to be considerate to their fellow students.

This class meets for one two-hour and thirty minute session each week. Students are epected to be present and active participants in each class. If attendance is a serious problem, or students aren't able to focus, students should consider the benefits of taking this class at another time when they do have time to commit. It is advised that students do not miss more than 2 classes.

Unexcused absences or missed deadlines constitute a failure of the assignment.

## Assessment

Final grade is determined:

- Class Participation: 40%
- Weekly Assignments: 30%
- Final Project: 30%

## Materials

All students are expected to bring a laptop to every class. We will be using free software:

- [pure data](https://puredata.info/)
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) or [Processing](https://processing.org/)
- a code editor of your choice ([Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

Additionally, many ideas are visual, or conceptual but benefit from visualization, it will be **very helpful** if students come to class with paper and some type of writing utensil.

Materials provided by the university

- molding clay (week 3)
- compasses (week 4)

### STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

### STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.  For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook, which can be found online at: http://students.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html

### STATEMENT ON ACCESSIBILITY

Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212 998-4980 for further information.

### STATEMENT ON COUNSELING AND WELLNESS

Your health and safety are a priority at NYU. If you experience any health or mental health issues during this course, we encourage you to utilize the support services of the 24/7 NYU Wellness Exchange 212-443-9999.

Please let your instructor know if you need help connecting to these resources.

### STATEMENT ON USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES

Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations.  Phone use in class is strictly prohibited unless directly related to a presentation of your own work or if you are asked to do so as part of the curriculum.

### STATEMENT ON TITLE IX
